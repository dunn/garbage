709. A man might have *this* picture of what *seeing* is: there is the
     *seer* and there is the *thing seen*.  The one *sees* the other.
     A typical *philosophical* theory.

710. We wish to ask: what are we supposed to *do* with this picture?

711. A man might say: 'I can't see a thing' and 'I can't see a thing
     but the fog.'  *Both* might be true.

712. 'I can't see a thing in this fog.'  *Which* thing?

713. 'A man is looking for a thing in a fog.  There is the man and
     there is the thing.  *That* is the picture.'  Yes, but now try to
     picture the *fog*.  What has become of the *first* picture?

714. A fog isn't a something, but it isn't a nothing either.

715. See this as a picture of a fog:

     Now take the fog away.

716. 'Yes, but I can see *better* when there isn't a fog.'  Is a fog,
     then, the *absence* of something?

717. 'A fog is what there is when the radio says 'there is a fog' and
     what the radio says is *true!*'  (A grammatical point).

718. 'The fog gets *between* me and what I want to see.  The fog
     *obscures* the thing I want to see.'  And could there be
     *another* fog that gets between me and the first one?  A *mental*
     fog?  Obscuration has to stop somewhere.

719. 'I *know* there is a fog because I can't see anything.'  (And how
     do you know you can't see anything?)

720. 'A fog is what you can see when you can't see anything else.'
     This gives a *use* to the expression.

721. How should we determine when someone has mastered the use of the
     expression 'fog'?  Someone might say, for instance, 'I am lost in
     the fog and can't go on'.  This would *shew* that he knows how to
     go on (in one sense of the expression.)

722. Think how we learn to use the word 'fog'.  *A* points to a thing
     which *B* cannot see.  *A* says: 'that is because of the fog'.
     (Similar language games: 'because the lights are out,' 'because
     you've lost your glasses,' 'because your eyes are closed,'
     because it isn't there.')

723. 'I cannot *hear* a thing in this fog.'  This, also, might have a
     use.  A *different* language game.

724. A man decides to keep a diary.  Whenever he cannot see what he is
     writing, he writes down 'fog'.  But here the thought that he is
     writing something down is *mere shew*.  (A diary written entirely
     in *invisible ink*.)

725. Point to the fog.  Now point away from it.  Now brush your
     teeth.  (Philosophy as a kind of *activity*).

726. How do you know there isn't *always* a fog (only a *transparent* one?)

727. Whatever can be seen can be seen clearly; and wherein you cannot
     see, thereof you must be silent.
