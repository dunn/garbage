<p>I don&rsquo;t really know why all of a sudden I&rsquo;m so cut up about
@Horse_ebooks
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-human-behind-a-favorite-spambot-horse_ebooks/" title="Jenna Wortham: The Human Behind a Favorite Spambot, Horse_eBooks">not being real</a>.
(Yes, in this context a spambot algorithm is real while a person
isn&rsquo;t.)  When I first read Dan Sinker&rsquo;s
<a href="http://dansinker.com/post/62183207705/eulogy-for-a-horse">&ldquo;Eulogy for a horse&rdquo;</a>
I thought it was a bit over-dramatic, but then I started talking about
the whole affair with other people and their grief seeped into me or
something and now I&rsquo;m actually pretty upset about a spambot account on
Twitter turning out to be something other than a spambot.</p>

<p>Of course there are plenty of people who don&rsquo;t care; either they claim
to have known it wasn&rsquo;t real since 2011 (granted,
<a href="http://gawker.com/5887697/how-i-found-the-human-being-behind-horseebooks-the-internets-favorite-spambot" title="Adrian Chen: How I Found the Human Being Behind Horse_ebooks, The
Internet's Favorite Spambot">the evidence was there</a>) or just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal, really.  A great twitter account turned out to be
fake, and our faith in others
<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/horse-ebooks-the-dril-question" title="John Herrman and Katie Notopoulos: Horse_Ebooks: The Dril Question">shook a little</a>.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still a shame.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">What&rsquo;s wrong with finding two men in a horse suit</h1>

<p>I went back to
<a href="http://dansinker.com/post/62183207705/eulogy-for-a-horse" title="Eulogy for a horse">Dan Sinker&rsquo;s piece</a> and this struck me as important (as important as
any piece of commentary on something that&rsquo;s not a big deal can be):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that everything wonderful ends up turning to shit and why
can’t unicorns be real and fuck absolutely everything I hate it all.</p>

<p>OK, maybe that last one wasn&rsquo;t a question.</p>

<p>But still.  If this is art, art is about context.  And I don&rsquo;t know
that I have enough context to know entirely how to feel.</p>

<p>Because I feel shitty.</p>

<p>And I feel confused about feeling shitty.</p>

<p>Buzzfeed being attached to this&mdash;even tangentially&mdash;I think plays
deeply into that feeling, because that site is first-and-foremost
about manipulating the science of clicks and likes, and if this is
all @Horse was, then god help us all.  But also &ldquo;Performance art&rdquo;
feels like a cop-out, and the actual performance today&mdash;based on
descriptions&mdash;reinforces that.  You can&rsquo;t just put a placard on a
wall and call it art.  I mean, I went to art school and so I know
that you <em>can</em>, but you&rsquo;d better back that up with the mother of all
context.  I don&rsquo;t have that context yet, so I guess I&rsquo;m skeptical,
and I don&rsquo;t want to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because while
<a href="https://twitter.com/jitka/status/382699605638393856" title="Tweet from 24 Sept 2013">@jitka&rsquo;s right</a> that the publicity from this will benefit
BuzzFeed, a company that&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/typo/8-conservative-wins-on-buzzfeed-dot-com-9lu0" title="typo: 8 Conservative #WINS On BuzzFeeᴅ Dot Com">increasingly throwing in its lot</a> with the radical
right, what I&rsquo;m sad about right now is that the <em>New Yorker&rsquo;s</em>
announcement this morning took away the context that made
@Horse_ebooks special.  Most of @Horse_ebooks&rsquo;
<a href="http://favstar.fm/users/Horse_ebooks" title="@Horse_ebooks on Favstar">most popular tweets</a> are still funny, but the composition
wasn&rsquo;t any better than a lot of funny Twitter accounts, and a lot
worse than some.  What made @Horse_ebooks tweets so wonderful was the
<em>belief</em> that a crummy algorithm designed to churn out text in order
to evade Twitter&rsquo;s spam filters could create such pretty nonsense.</p>

<p>And we lost that belief.</p>

<p>Which is why, even though @Horse_ebooks

title="Virgil Texas: Is the creator of @Horse_ebooks playing us for
fools?">&quot;got funnier&quot;</a> in September of 2011,
<a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/news/twitter-horse-ebooks/1/" title="Jon Hendren: @Horse_ebooks">earlier tweets</a> from when it was still a real spambot
suddenly seem preferable, actually better, because they&rsquo;re <em>real</em>.</p>
