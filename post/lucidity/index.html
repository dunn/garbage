<hr />

<p>Santa Barbara-based <a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/" title="Lucidity Festival website">Lucidity Festival</a> has a problem with cultural
appropriation.  Unfortunately, the organizers don&rsquo;t seem to have a
firm grasp on what &lsquo;cultural appropriation&rsquo; means, and so they don&rsquo;t
see what the big deal is or why they should make changes to their
festival.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Who did what now?</h1>

<p>Lucidity Festival takes place in the
<a href="http://www.countyofsb.org/parks/parks05.aspx?id=9378" title="County of Santa Barbara Parks Division">Live Oak campground</a> in Santa Ynez and is
described as an
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/about-us/" title="About Us">&ldquo;open-source transformational arts and music festival&rdquo;</a> (I for one want to see the source code).  Lucidity
Festival LLC was
<a href="http://companies.findthecompany.com/l/29796704/Lucidity-Festival-Llc-in-Santa-Barbara-CA" title="FindTheCompany.com listing">founded in 2012</a> and the first festival was held from
April 13&ndash;15 of that year.  The theme of the 2012 event was &ldquo;Awake in
Your Dreams&rdquo;, which involved your standard
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/lucidity-story/" title="Six
Year Story Arc">New Age nonsense</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We, the Dreamers of the New Dawn, have stirred in our slumber.  As
the eye of consciousness opened, we recognized the dream as a dream
while we were still within the dream!  The experience of lucidity
unfolds into the understanding that each of us has infinite
potential, that we are able to let go of fear and are free to create
that which we want to see in the world.  This sunrise of awareness
marks an ever-present-now moment of self-discovery&mdash;the birth of
something beautiful.  This inception is a time to explore the many
archetypes that exist within each of us&mdash;healers, warriors,
renegades, lovers, tricksters&mdash;and as part of a grand human family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(We could spend some time worrying about these &ldquo;archetypes&rdquo; and what
sort of appropriation might be going on there, but that&rsquo;s pretty minor
compared to what&rsquo;s next.)</p>

<p>The 2013 festival took place from the 12th to the 14th of this month.
The theme this year was <a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/lucidity-story/" title="Six
Year Story Arc">&ldquo;The Totems&rsquo; Return&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eyes, heart, and spirit are wide open as we begin to examine the
world anew.  We are lucid and loving it!  We recognize that all that
can be seen, smelled, touched, tasted, and heard upon this great
ocean of infinity is a beautiful reflection of that which exists
within us.  In this next chapter, you embark on a deep and joyful
dive into the heart of who and what you are.  The animal totem
spirits of our world are here to guide you.  We call forth The
Totems&rsquo; Return, ushered in by wise Owl, humble Tiger, courageous
Dragon, wild Monkey, loving Dove, and playful Coyote.  This next
chapter is simultaneously an invitation to reconnect with the animal
within and an opportunity to learn from each totem&rsquo;s strengths and
weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The header image for the 2013 Lucidity Festival places great emphasis
on these &ldquo;totems&rdquo;:</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Why is this a problem?</h1>

<p>This is cultural appropriation of the worst sort.  Lucidity Festival
is taking traditions of Indigenous tribes of the Pacific Northwest out
of their historical context, trivializing them, and using them as
costumes for white hippies to wear while play-acting in the mountains
for a weekend.</p>

<p>In what follows I&rsquo;ll be using the definition of &lsquo;cultural
appropriation&rsquo; given by
<a href="http://clairelight.typepad.com/seelight/2009/01/defining-cultural-appropriation.html" title="Defining and Identifying Cultural Appropriation">Claire Light</a>:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Cultural Appropriation</dt>
<dd>The unhealthy aspect of [multiculturalism], where a more powerful culture raids a less powerful neighboring culture … and appropriates aspects of that culture without proper acknowledgment of the “home culture” or understanding the cultural context from which these aspects spring.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>(Katie Baker cites
<a href="http://jezebel.com/5959698/a-much+needed-primer-on-cultural-appropriation" title="A Much-Needed Primer on Cultural Appropriation">a more terse definition given by Susan Scafidi</a>: &ldquo;Taking
intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or
artifacts from someone else&rsquo;s culture without permission.&ldquo;)</p>

<p>Light contrasts cultural appropriation with cultural <em>syncretism</em>,
which is the inevitable mixing that occurs when cultures &ldquo;come into
contact with one another, either through geographical proximity,
migration, conquest, trade and exploration, or in other ways&rdquo;.  There
is nothing inherently wrong with this sort of cultural exchange.  What
makes cultural appropriation a problem is that &ldquo;<em>cultural
appropriation is about an exploitative power dynamic</em>&rdquo;.  Robin Gray
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/outputs/blog/appropriation-month-first-nation-totem-poles" title="Appropriation \(?\) of the Month: First Nation Totem Poles">puts this well</a> in an
essay specifically about the appropriation of totem poles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Appropriation is not just the process by which people borrow from
other cultures; it is also about controlling knowledge <em>about</em>
&ldquo;Other&rdquo; cultures.  Indeed, the appropriation of Indigenous cultural
heritage has been a strategy for controlling the knowledge produced
about Indigenous cultures and peoples, the power to control the
means of knowledge production and the power to set the terms of its
use-value within society.  Simply put, the appropriation of the
totem pole has served to further trivialize northwest coast First
Nations cultures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The behavior Lucidity is engaging in involves representing the complex
traditions of Indigenous peoples from the Pacific Northwest as little
more than a set of inspirations around which anyone is free to develop
their own
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/totem-villages/your-own/" title="Create Your Own Totem Tribe">&ldquo;Totem Tribe&rdquo;</a> as part of some bullshit exercise in
personal expression.  The
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/community-totems/">&ldquo;Community Totems&rdquo; created by attendees</a>
and listed on the Lucidity website are a perfect example of culturally
ignorant individuals callously mashing together random aspects of
different minority cultures while exoticizing and demeaning them.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>What&rsquo;s your favorite mythological/fantastical/imaginative creature?</p>&mdash; Lucidity Festival (@LucidityFest) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucidityFest/status/284096417188966400">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
</p>

<p>What Lucidity is doing here is lumping Indigenous tribes together with
mythological, fantastical, and imaginative &ldquo;creatures&rdquo;.  And,
<a href="http://jezebel.com/5959698/a-much+needed-primer-on-cultural-appropriation" title="A Much-Needed Primer on Cultural Appropriation">in the words of Jennifer Weston</a>, &ldquo;to pretend that
we&rsquo;re fictional characters vs. real people from real cultures is not
only offensive, and racist, it&rsquo;s a vicious act suppressing our lived
realities as Native peoples, and an appropriation of our very
identities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You might not see why the totem poles are a big deal.  In fact, if
this were an isolated act it might <em>not</em> be a very big deal.  But it&rsquo;s
part of a larger pattern of marginalizing minority groups by treating
their culture as an accessory for members of the dominant group.</p>

<p>Consider the wearing of headdresses.  This is obviously problematic
because,
<a href="http://jezebel.com/5959698/a-much+needed-primer-on-cultural-appropriation" title="A Much-Needed Primer on Cultural Appropriation">as Jennifer Weston points out in an article by Katie Baker</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the plains Indian war bonnets that the ubiquitous hipster/Victoria&rsquo;s
Secret &amp; other fashionista &ldquo;feather headdresses&rdquo; are modeled on are
actual historical sacred ceremonial pieces, sometimes called regalia
(but not costumes).  While ceremonies varied among the diverse
plains tribes who produced these headdresses, most involved specific
prayers and actions, often relating to EACH single feather.  Honor
songs and ceremonies, for men and women warriors, come from our
languages and represent ancient spiritual practices deeply tied to
tribal homelands and their biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Casually wearing a headdress involves not only trivializing a sacred
object but also, says Adrienne K.,
<a href="http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/04/but-why-cant-i-wear-a-hipster-headdress.html" title="But Why Can't I Wear a Hipster Headdress?">&ldquo;collapsing distinct cultures, and in doing so &hellip; asserting your power over them&rdquo;</a> by treating the various
Indigenous societies as a single, static, <em>dead</em> culture that can be
raided freely.  (Someone <em>did</em> post the Adrienne K. article just
quoted on

<p>Seen in this light, Lucidity&rsquo;s use of totem poles is part of a
<em>system</em> of cultural appropriation that is <em>actively harmful</em> to
Indigenous communities.</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">What does Lucidity have to say about all this?</h1>

<p>Given that the organizers of Lucidity Festival engage in and promote
unacceptable acts of cultural appropriation, it&rsquo;s not surprising that
they&rsquo;ve heard this criticism before.  It&rsquo;s also not surprising that
their response, written by Lucidity co-founder and Marketing Director
<a href="http://jonahhaas.wordpress.com/" title="lifeways and
dreamscapes">Jonah Haas</a>, makes
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/make-your-own-totem-poster/" title="Make your own Totem Poster">everything so much worse</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are sensitive to the cultural appropriation discussion, and our
choice to celebrate totems was certainly not ignorant to those
concerns. We are a tribe. This is our totem. We are influenced by
many traditions and many animal energies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be hilarious if it wasn&rsquo;t so dangerous.  Let me put this as
clearly as I can: <strong><em>No, you&rsquo;re not.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now you might say that I&rsquo;m sticking my neck out here.  Human
intelligence is notoriously limited, and it&rsquo;s very hard to be sure
that we ever <em>know</em> anything.  Fine.  I&rsquo;m <em>almost certain</em> Lucidity
Festival is not a tribe.  It&rsquo;s long, but I don&rsquo;t see them anywhere on
the list of
<a href="http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-020700.pdf" title="Bureau of Indian Affairs pdf">Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the Bureau of Indian Affairs</a>.</p>

<p>This is far from conclusive, of course.  There are probably many
tribes who have been refused federal recognition, and so do not appear
on the Bureau of Indian Affairs&rsquo; list.  It&rsquo;s possible that Lucidity is
one of these erased tribes.  But they&rsquo;re not on this
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrecognized_tribes" title="Wikipedia">list of unrecognized tribes</a>, and I can&rsquo;t find any evidence supporting Jonah Haas&rsquo;
claim to tribe-hood.  (If he can provide documentation I would happily
update this post to reflect it.)</p>

<p>My <em>educated guess</em> is that the members of Lucidity do <em>not</em>
constitute an indigenous society with historical ties to the region
and a unique cultural identity.  But maybe that&rsquo;s not what Haas meant.
Maybe he meant something like &ldquo;a group of privileged Californians who
get together once a year and do drugs at Live Oak&rdquo;.  OK.  There&rsquo;s
nothing <em>wrong</em> with that.  From the testimonia on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LucidityFestival">Lucidity&rsquo;s Facebook page</a>,
it sounds like people had fun.  Good for them!  If that&rsquo;s all that was
meant by &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;, then this wouldn&rsquo;t be such a problem.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s <em>obvious</em> that Haas means more than that.  Lucidity&rsquo;s
promotional materials are <em>rife</em> with references to the traditions and
imagery of Indigenous peoples, especially those of the Pacific
Northwest.  The poster for 2013 prominently featured&mdash;of
course&mdash;<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/totem_poster11x17_final_for_WEB.jpg" title="Promotional Poster for Lucidity 2013">a totem pole</a>, and the Facebook page makes
references to specific tribes like
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1272922&amp;l=64aef3cea8&amp;id=292660907453656">the Chumash</a>
as well as posts of generic (and Othering) pieces of &ldquo;art&rdquo; that serve
as a blank canvas on which commenters might project themselves:</p>

</figure>

<p>We&rsquo;ve gone off the rails a bit, haven&rsquo;t we?  Let&rsquo;s get back to our
close reading of Jonah Haas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rest assured, this IS our own original digital imagery, with
multi-cultural influence.  Each totem image was crafted by our
community&rsquo;s creative, Mark Goerner, they were each chosen for the
type of energy they imbue, they are a symbolic representation of our
community&rsquo;s life force, they were informed by MANY traditions,
notice the inclusion of the dragon, the tiger, the coyote, the
monkey, the dove, the owl.  The totem pole itself was not ripped off
either, while it was inspired, in part, by Pacific NorthWest
aesthetic, it is our collective representation of the archetypal
energy of our tribe. This design was created by Matt Rodriguez,
another one of our skilled artists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&rsquo;re not a fucking tribe.  (See above.)</p></li>

<li><p>You&rsquo;re guilty of cultural appropriation, not intellectual property
theft.  While theft of tribal IP is a
<a href="http://lawlib.lclark.edu/blog/native_america/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Indian-IP-Rights.pdf" title="PDF: American Indian and Tribal Intellectual Property Rights">huge problem</a>,
there are other kinds of cultural appropriation.  Nobody is
accusing you of &ldquo;ripping off&rdquo; the designs of real totem poles.  In
fact, the problem is exactly that you <em>failed</em> to treat the
original pole designs with sufficient respect.
<a href="http://beyondbuckskin.blogspot.ca/2013/01/misappropriation-and-case-of-yellow.html" title="Misappropriation and the Case of the Yellow Crotch">Jessica Metcalfe&rsquo;s point about a horrendous fashion collection</a> applies here
as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He produced this &hellip; with little to no knowledge of the complex
stylistic conventions of Northwest Coast. Designs such as his
actively work to reduce public respect for the deep cultural
knowledge and artistic skill needed to design, create, and carve
a pole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that <a href="http://www.grnr.com/">Mark Goerner&rsquo;s</a> designs were
superficially &ldquo;informed by MANY traditions&rdquo; is <em>precisely the
problem</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Moving on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our use of the totem imagery and the totem concept incorporates and
celebrates a way of life that is inspiring to us.  Exploring the
aspects of self that are represented by the various spirit animals
is the second chapter of our six year story &hellip; if you haven&rsquo;t read,
we invite you to see the deeper intention of what is going on here
<a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/lucidity-story/">http://lucidityfestival.com/lucidity-story/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appropriating aspects of Indigenous culture because they are
&ldquo;inspiring&rdquo; to you is not an excuse.  But let&rsquo;s follow that link,
shall we?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same &ldquo;Six Year Story Arc&rdquo; that provides explanations of each
year&rsquo;s &ldquo;theme&rdquo;.  I quoted from Years One (&ldquo;Awake in Your Dreams&rdquo;) and
Two (&ldquo;The Totems&rsquo; Return&rdquo;) above.  Year Three is some boilerplate New
Age scrawlings, but Year Four (&ldquo;Tribe Quest&rdquo;) is Bad News.  My emphasis
in what follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While your individual consciousness has tasted the sweetness of One
Love, our immediate three-dimensional, carbon-based reality presents
a tangible set of vital questions and challenges.  How do we live in
the world in right relationship with each other and the planet?  How
do we transform our cultures and societies to make space for a
brighter future for our children&rsquo;s children?  For the answers to
these questions, we spin back in time to learn from our ancestors.
In this Tribe Quest, <strong>we look to our indigenous knowledge systems,
ancient secrets, and native wisdom traditions and stand them
alongside that which is gleaned from scientific rigor and careful,
prolonged observation.</strong>  Ever looking, ever learning, ever loving,
ever lucid, we are coming together as one community with one voice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, Indigenous cultures are treated as exotic, &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;
curiosities to be rifled through, rather than as living traditions
that still exist today.</p>

<p>Haas ends his blog post with an invitation to further dialogue (&ldquo;And
as always, we are open to your thoughts, beliefs, opinions, and
criticisms.&ldquo;) and three paragraphs
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Totem&amp;oldid=539554546" title="Entry for \&quot;Totem\&quot; on 16:36, 21 February 2013">copied and pasted from Wikipedia</a>.
(What was that about not ripping things off?)  At no point is there
any admission of guilt or even admission of the <em>possibility</em> that
Lucidity is perpetuating racism against Indigenous peoples.
<em>Because they&rsquo;re a tribe too.</em></p>
