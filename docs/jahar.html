<p>Within half an hour of the Boston Bombing, conspiracy theorist and professional baby Alex Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAlexJones/status/323881158628761601" title="Tweet from @realalexjones on 15 April 2013">identified it (falsely, of course)</a> as a “false flag”: an <a href="http://gawker.com/5994754/false-flags-and-roof-terrorists-your-guide-to-all-the-internet-horseshit" title="Gawker: False Flags and Roof Terrorists: Your Guide to All the Internet Horseshit">“attack perpetrated by the government and used an excuse ‘to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security while sticking their hands down our pants on the streets.’”</a></p>
<p>Most adults don’t take Jones seriously, but there’s a large internet-savvy demographic that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>passionately embraces causes;</p></li>
<li><p>has a lot of spare time; and</p></li>
<li><p>is easily duped.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m referring, of course, to the teens.</p>
<h1 id="the-new-conspiracy-theorists">The new conspiracy theorists</h1>
<p>The same sorts of kids who will <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/nostrich/the-explosive-truth-behind-one-directions-gay-sca-2980" title="BuzzFeed: The Explosive Truth Behind One Direction&#39;s Gay Scandal">embrace any evidence</a>, no matter how weak, that supports their favorite <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ship" title="Urban Dictionary definition for &quot;ship&quot;">“ship”</a>, have <a href="http://gawker.com/freejahar-when-conspiracy-theorists-and-one-direction-478152664" title="Gawker: #FreeJahar: When Conspiracy Theorists and One Direction Fans Collide">thrown their support behind the #FreeJahar movement</a>. One Direction fans accepted without question the assurances of an internet stranger that bandmembers Harry and Louis were in a secret relationship because they <em>wanted</em> it to be true. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (nicknamed “Jahar”) is very attractive to the teenage Tumblr crowd, so they <em>want</em> him to be innocent, and will buy the silliest theories that confirm what they want to believe.</p>
<p>With this all in mind it’s <em>obvious</em> that someone would write erotic fan fiction about Jahar. I still can’t believe it took <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanIdunno/status/331234768211542017" title="Tweet by @duncanidunno on 5 May 2013">this</a> to make me realize that, <em>of course there’s erotic fan fiction about Jahar</em>.</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<h1 id="kids-these-days">Kids these days</h1>
<p>My internet excavations only turned up two pieces of erotic fan fiction about Jahar (if you find more <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn" title="Twitter">tell me</a>). And one of them doesn’t have any sex! But we work with what we have.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pastebin.com/ehxjU0s8" title="Pastebin: Jahar Fanfic">first one</a> is forgettable aside from some incredibly awkward conversation and a cute reference to the fandom that spawned the piece: “Jahar had managed to get himself fan girls who were extremely disgruntled that he had a long-term girlfriend who hadn’t given up on him.” In the story, Jahar is proven innocent—due, somehow, to the talk-show appearances of the narrator girlfriend—and returns to his long-suffering lover. They eat pizza and <a href="http://pastebin.com/ehxjU0s8" title="Pastebin: Jahar Fanfic">watch all three <em>Lord of the Rings</em> films in one sitting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m feeling a bit of Lord of The Rings you know,” he said as he followed suit, dumping the food on the table. He quickly got the first LoTR out of the case and slot it into the DVD Player and switched the TV on. Then came and sat next to me on the sofa, placing his arm around my waist, pulling me into him. Through out the movies he fed me pizza and stroked my hair while whispering stupid comments about the movies in my ear. Not even paying attention to the TV at points, just on me. Just watching me lovingly with a small smile on his face.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the movies finished, I was cuddled against his chest, he gently moved me away so he could turn off the TV and then picked me up bridal style, carrying me the stairs. He quietly entered our bedroom and placed me on the bed. Joining me seconds later, he pulled the comforter up, covering both of up and hugged me from behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Baby?” he whispered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mmm?” I said, turning around, placing my arms around his waist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I thought I had lost you forever, and it was hell, so I hope you know I ain’t planning on letting you go.” he said, kissing the top of my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And I hope you know that that’s completely fine with me,” I whispered into his chest. “I love you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I love you too.” he said, pulling me head on his chest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I smiled widely and slowly drifted to sleep, holding Jahar in my arms and listening to his heartbeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It ends with this disclaimer, which is more than necessary considering the <a href="http://electra-noor.tumblr.com/post/49026716220/i-think-what-pisses-me-off-the-most-about-the" title="Tumblr: heavens in your eyes">outrage</a> amongst other teen activists who accuse the fanfic authors of <a href="http://j4har.tumblr.com/post/48745534335/the-person-that-wrote-the-fanfic-about-dzhokhar" title="Tumblr: j4har">not taking this whole thing seriously enough</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please know that I support Jahar and believe he is innocent and not because he’s cute. I’m against fanfics but my friend asked me to write a ‘cute’ one without sex, so I did. It helped me clear my mind after a weeks worth of stress and sleepless night because of this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/5aVnq0LW" title="Pastebin: Someone made a fanfic about Jahar Tsarnaev">The <em>second</em> fan fiction</a> has no such disclaimer—or it was lost as the fanfic was spread around Tumblr. It’s written strangely, in the second person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You didn’t believe that the sweet young boy could have caused such madness, you didn’t believe he even wanted to. No matter how many pictures and lies were spread, you just knew.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You decided it was finally time to try and sleep, it did you no good to sit on the couch and worry. You had been instructed to keep the door locked, but you were so confident that this boy was harmless, that If he did come running to your door you would happily let him in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The creaking sound of footsteps on your hardwood floor woke you up after only one measly hour of sleep. It was too dark to see anything, as you had covered the windows to silence the violence outside. Your eyes searched the room endlessly trying to decipher what the cause of that eerie creaking was. A hand slipped over your mouth as a weight shifted on the bed beside you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Promise you won’t scream.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things escalate pretty quickly when “you” start cleaning his wound:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bite down on this love.” You directed him. You weren’t a trained medical professional, but you knew what to do in these situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He bit down on the towel, and wrapped his hands around his leg above the gunshot, slowing the bleeding. You didn’t hesitate, sticking the tweezers in and feeling for the bullet, you knew it would hurt but the faster the better. He groaned into the towel and his knuckles were turning white around his leg. You got hold of the bullet and pulled it out as quick as you could, grabbing the towel from him and shoving it down onto the wound. He breathed heavily and leaved his back against the wall as you held the towel in place, now more aware than ever that you were so close to naked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You know, you’re really pretty for a terrorist sympathizer.” Jahar finally spoke after the medicine kicked in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What did you expect?” You asked him, more comfortable with your nakedness now knowing he found you attractive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the author’s credit, some attempt is made to square this fucked-up alternate history with actual events and human realities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did you rob that 7/11?” You asked him, as you sat on the bed next to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Noo, of course not, I was just buying something to eat, I guess they just decided to use that picture and say I was robbing it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And that cop?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What cop?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You haven’t been watching the news? A cop was killed at MIT, they’re blaming you and your brother.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You saw his face drop, he was suddenly remembering that his brother was dead. You knew that was enough questions for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No <em>shit</em> he hasn’t been watching the news. But how are we going to get to the sexytimes if Jahar’s being treated as an actual person who just lost his brother?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you live alone?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“yeah, don’t worry, nobody is going to come in and notice you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh I wasn’t worried about that, I just didn’t want them to hear us.” You were confused about what he meant</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hear us what?” You asked, only a second before he leaned over and pressed his lips up to yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, like that.</p>
<p>This is all leading, of course, to a completely demented climax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bit of light shone through the window, a bit of panic swept over you and you pushed him away, and ran over to the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You opened the shade enough to see you, and you saw the big bright light of a helicopter search light shining all around the neighborhood. You thought they knew, but quickly they changed paths and you could tell they were looking randomly. You were so scared for Jahar, but he seemed calm. He was behind you suddenly, while your hands held on to the frame of the window he slid his hand down your stomach and started rubbing it against your slit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“cmon baby, give me something to think about in jail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As he said that, his dick slid into you finally, releasing all the frustration you had built up. He slammed you against the window, the curtain fell to the floor. You tried to push away so you could get him away from the window, but he was fucking you so well you didn’t have the strength to. Your tits were pushed against the cold window as he strode in and out of you, making you moan with your cheek touchingthe cold glass. He didn’t stop when you thought he would, he was too much for you now and he had to grip your thighs to keep you from falling to the ground. Suddenly the search light shone right at you, the sound of megaphones blaring things like “there he is!” “upstairs!” He shoved in you once more, hard and deep, making you both cum, both moaning, both hearts beating with such adrenaline. He pulled out of your, kissed your lips hard as he pulled his pants up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t forget about me when the news stops showing my face baby.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The door flew open, guns pointed at the back of his head, he was pushed to the ground and dragged out. They hardly even noticed you there, you assumed you would be arrested too for helping him, but they were so caught up in making him look bad, they just took him away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “serious” members of #FreeJahar are furious about the existence of this majestic piece of erotica because they realize that it tarnishes and trivializes their movement. But the fact that so many feel the need to repeat that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=freejahar+not+because+he&#39;s+cute&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=freejahar+not+because+he&#39;s+cute&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57.6953j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="Google search"><em>they’re not just doing this because he’s cute!</em></a> suggests that this is the logical conclusion of #FreeJahar; that imagining getting fucked by an adorable fugitive is, really, what this is all about.</p>
