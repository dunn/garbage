<p>Today <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley">@shanley</a> wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/82978662b2d6" title="Things I Never, Ever Want To Hear Again">great piece</a> that was made even greater because of the people on Twitter who rose to the challenge of proving her points for her.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
And right on cue, Dudebros <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless">@leashless</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisbeach">@chrisbeach</a> and others are now literally doing the <em>exact thing</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley">@shanley</a> wrote that Dudebros do.

<p>When I talk about oppression, patriarchy and my experiences in tech, I can feel many things. I may feel sad, amused, jovial, excited, creative, expressive, calm, eager, curious, playful, afraid. How do you know the contents of my inner emotional life through 140 characters, a 4-minute blog post, or a 20-minute speech? You don’t, but that doesn’t really matter, after all. No, to you, I’m just angry.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these men bother to ask women how they are actually feeling, even as they fall all over themselves calling her angry. Because what she actually feels is irrelevant. Calling a woman angry isn’t about identifying or empathizing with her emotions. It’s about shaming, humiliating, debasing, policing and discrediting her.</p>

<p>But sometimes I <em>am</em> angry. And I stand by my anger, all of it, every day. Here’s your daily reminder that women are violently, disproportionally, systematically and systemically raped, stalked, harassed, assaulted, molested, beaten, underpaid, underpromoted, silenced, erased, gaslighted, maltreated and objectified. And that is a very partial list among a host of other institutionalized abuses. <strong>If you think it’s inappropriate to be angry, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.</strong></p>

<p>[B]elieve me that being a father and husband sure as fuck doesn’t mean that you’re not a misogynist pig merrily derailing, slandering and damaging while you roll about in the slop of your white male privilege. And frankly, I don’t give a damn about how many women you know if you’re just going to use them as silent props to protect you from the Big Bad Feminists, and from taking any responsibility whatsoever for your words and actions.</p>

<p>I have actively participated in bro culture within this industry, with all of its casual misogyny, racism and homophobia. I’m guilty of uncritically benefiting from white supremacy and helping to construct it. And I am guilty of being myopically concerned about my own oppression. I’m very early in my own personal path, but I’m getting better every day.</p>
<p>And I keep trying.</p>
