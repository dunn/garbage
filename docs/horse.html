<h1 id="buzzfeed-took-our-horse-out-back-and-shot-it">BuzzFeed took our horse out back and shot it</h1>
<p>I don’t really know why all of a sudden I’m so cut up about <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse_ebooks">@Horse_ebooks</span> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-human-behind-a-favorite-spambot-horse_ebooks/" title="Jenna Wortham: The Human Behind a Favorite Spambot, Horse_eBooks">not being real</a>. (Yes, in this context a spambot algorithm is real while a person isn’t.) When I first read Dan Sinker’s <a href="http://dansinker.com/post/62183207705/eulogy-for-a-horse">“Eulogy for a horse”</a> I thought it was a bit over-dramatic, but then I started talking about the whole affair with other people and their grief seeped into me or something and now I’m actually pretty upset about a spambot account on Twitter turning out to be something other than a spambot.</p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of people who don’t care; either they claim to have known it wasn’t real since 2011 (granted, <a href="http://gawker.com/5887697/how-i-found-the-human-being-behind-horseebooks-the-internets-favorite-spambot" title="Adrian Chen: How I Found the Human Being Behind Horse_ebooks, The Internet&#39;s Favorite Spambot">the evidence was there</a>) or just don’t think it’s a big deal.</p>
<p>It’s not a big deal, really. A great twitter account turned out to be fake, and our faith in others <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/horse-ebooks-the-dril-question" title="John Herrman and Katie Notopoulos: Horse_Ebooks: The Dril Question">shook a little</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s still a shame.</p>
<h1 id="whats-wrong-with-finding-two-men-in-a-horse-suit">What’s wrong with finding two men in a horse suit</h1>
<p>I went back to <a href="http://dansinker.com/post/62183207705/eulogy-for-a-horse" title="Eulogy for a horse">Dan Sinker’s piece</a> and this struck me as important (as important as any piece of commentary on something that’s not a big deal can be):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that everything wonderful ends up turning to shit and why can’t unicorns be real and fuck absolutely everything I hate it all.</p>
<p>OK, maybe that last one wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>But still. If this is art, art is about context. And I don’t know that I have enough context to know entirely how to feel.</p>
<p>Because I feel shitty.</p>
<p>And I feel confused about feeling shitty.</p>
<p>Buzzfeed being attached to this—even tangentially—I think plays deeply into that feeling, because that site is first-and-foremost about manipulating the science of clicks and likes, and if this is all <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse">@Horse</span> was, then god help us all. But also “Performance art” feels like a cop-out, and the actual performance today—based on descriptions—reinforces that. You can’t just put a placard on a wall and call it art. I mean, I went to art school and so I know that you <em>can</em>, but you’d better back that up with the mother of all context. I don’t have that context yet, so I guess I’m skeptical, and I don’t want to be.</p>

<p>Because while <a href="https://twitter.com/jitka/status/382699605638393856" title="Tweet from 24 Sept 2013">@jitka’s right</a> that the publicity from this will benefit BuzzFeed, a company that’s <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/typo/8-conservative-wins-on-buzzfeed-dot-com-9lu0" title="typo: 8 Conservative #WINS On BuzzFeeᴅ Dot Com">increasingly throwing in its lot</a> with the radical right, what I’m sad about right now is that the <em>New Yorker’s</em> announcement this morning took away the context that made <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse_ebooks">@Horse_ebooks</span> special. Most of <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse_ebooks">@Horse_ebooks</span>’ <a href="http://favstar.fm/users/Horse_ebooks" title="@Horse_ebooks on Favstar">most popular tweets</a> are still funny, but the composition wasn’t any better than a lot of funny Twitter accounts, and a lot worse than some. What made <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse_ebooks">@Horse_ebooks</span> tweets so wonderful was the <em>belief</em> that a crummy algorithm designed to churn out text in order to evade Twitter’s spam filters could create such pretty nonsense.</p>
<p>And we lost that belief.</p>
<p>Which is why, even though <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse_ebooks">@Horse_ebooks</span> <a
